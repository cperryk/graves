    <h1>Game of Thrones Graveyard</h1>

    <p>This is a restoration of the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/04/game_of_thrones_deaths_mourn_dead_characters_at_their_virtual_graveyard.html"><i>Slate</i> Game of Thrones Graveyard</a>, which ran through the series' final seasons.</p>

    <p>
      As <i>Slate</i>'s website has evolved, many old interactive projects became broken, and fixing them all is infeasible. I restored this one just because I was a huge fan of the show, which was notorious for killing characters in unpredictable and brutal fashion, and it was one of my most popular cultural pieces at <i>Slate</i>. This one was the right mix of simple, amusing, and satirical.
